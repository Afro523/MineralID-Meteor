The Manganite from Ilfeld has yet to be surpassed in quality to this day. Numerous examples of Manganite illustrations have been figured by  Mohs and many others over the years.This specimen shows incredible, highly reflective luster to which Ilfeld Manganites are famous for. The columnar, shiny black prismatic crystals of Manganite reach 2cm. Each crystal is terminated showing no damage except one crystal on the far side. Further, the terminations show several prismatic forms in combination with numerous parallel columns, which, I believe, classifies them as a type II crystal as described by Moore (pg. 495). This specimen comes with an old University of Chicago label dated 1963 stating that the donor was \"English\". I assume this to be the late, great George English. It has matching ID numbers on label to specimen.  If you were to have a classic in your collection from a famous region in Germany, as all upper end collectors have, this would be a specimen to purchase.

Optically, it is biaxial with indices of refraction between 1.735 to 1.750 measured in the (011) face and fair pleochroism.Originally found at La Creusaz uranium prospect near the village of Les Marécottes, Trient Valley, Valais in the Alps of Switzerland.

On this specimen the Marecottite occurs with bright canary yellow Natrozippeite. Most of what you see is the Natrozippeite, which is on and presumably formed after the Marecottite. The zippeite is highly fluorescent yellow and is powdery. The Marecottite is a little fluorescent also, which is contrary ot the type locality where Marecottite is nonfluorescent. This may be due to solid solution since Marecottite is a member of the Zippeite group. Purchased from Dr. Jaroslav Hrysl.

Lithium pegmatites are rare and constitute about 1-2% of all pegmatites. Most lithium pegmatites are zoned and usually occur at the furthest extents from the parent source and usually intrude metamorphic rock. Rarely do the minerals Petalite and Spodumene occur in the same pegmatite since Spodumene is stable at higher pressures and moderate temperature unlike Petalite (high T and moderate P)...then there is the secondary lithium mineral Eucryptite which is stable at low P and T. See Cerny and/or London...Dr, David London of University of Oklahoma has shown that pegmatite formation under conditions of silica (quartz) saturated conditions, the lithium aluminum silicates petalite, spodumene and eucryptite are good indicators of the temperature and pressure of formation. Spodumene at equilibrium occurs at high pressure, while petalite at high temperatures, But upon cooling, spodumene is sometimes seen as replacing petalite.In this specimen thin white laminations can be seen within the otherwise colorless matrix.

It occurs in manganese ore that in turn formed by the metamorphism of manganese-bearing sediments, and is usually associated with skarn.

Calcite is highly variable in color and forms, but it is most easily recognized by its reactivity to hydrochloric acid and even weaker acids like vinegar, which it will effervesce strongly when in contact with. Calcite can fluoresce red, blue, yellow, and many other colors and shades under both long-wave and short-wave ultraviolet light. It is also phosphorescent, cathodoluminescent, thermoluminescent and occasionally triboluminescent. Another telling property of Calcite is its strong optical birefringence which causes a double refraction, and thus double image, which can be viewed by looking at objects through a clear calcite specimen.",

The largest crystal shows good pseudohexagonal orthorhombic forms with flat pinacoids and striated(?) prism faces. I note the so-called striations since they seem to be characteristic for the species from the specimens I have seen. The flat terminations have a lot of weird patterns. Under shortwave UV the Zektzerite lights up a vivid yellow. Some ref's mention that it glows blue. This is an excellent specimen and was purchased by Chris van Laer from Randy Becker in 1987. Becker, who authored the 1991 article \"Minerals of the Golden Horn Batholith\" in Rocks and Minerals, collected this piece.The second specimen: A 2cm across the top and 9mm down the prism face. The top crystal is stacked on another below, perhaps bigger yet and in fact there are many crystals in this stack. Sprinkled upon the Zektzerite are acicular amphibole(?) crystals and the matrix is Microcline. Zektzerite is found in the miarolitic cavities and pegmatites in alkaline portions of the Golden Horn batholith, near Washington Pass in the North Cascades mountains of Washington. As noted by the formula, the mineral contains lithium and zirconium both of which characteristically get filtered out of the solidifying magma as it cools since these elements are usually rejected by most ordinary igneous rocks. Since Zektzerite needs sodium, it is typically found in agpatic rock, which is peralkaline, meaning that it is aluminum poor and sodium rich.  Zektzerite was first found in 1966 by Bart Cannon and named after Jack Zektzer both of Seattle. Cannon was at the fore-front of Washington Pass collecting. Hats off to these guys.All this information is taken from the Handbook of Mineralogy,  Mindat, Webmineral and Randy Becker's article in Rocks and Minerals journal v.66 n.6 (1991) - an excellent read.",

Type Locality - Commercial quarry, Crestmore, Sky Blue Hill, Riverside Co., California. Wayneburnhamite is the calcium anologue of Ganomalite and is isostructural with Ganomalite. Crystals occur on vesuvianite/wollastonite matrix and is presumed to have formed during metasomatism of galena impregnated limestone as a result of intrusion of quartz monozite. Wayneburnhamite forms sky blue, short prismatic hexagonal crystals to 0.5mm and clusters. The margins of the crystals are transparent while the cores are cloudy. The blue color is attributed to nonessential copper impurity. Wayneburnhamite is named for Dr. C. Wayne Burnham (1922-2015), who is best known for his work on the interaction of volatiles with igneous systems. Burnham also contributed to the understanding of the Crestmore geology and metamorphism. Most mineral collectors would also recognize Wayne Burnham as a co-founder of \"Burminco\", a mineral business partnered with his brother George.All information provided by authors: Anthony R. Kampf, Robert M. Housely, and George R. Rossman in: \"Wayneburnhamite, Pb9Ca6(Si2O7)3(SiO4)3, an apatite polysome: The Mn-free analog of ganomalite from Crestmore, California\" American Mineralogist vol. 101, pgs 2423-2429, 2016.Wayneburnhamite is a new mineral, designated IMA 2015-124. It is published in the American Mineralogist V.101, 2016 by Kampf, Housely, and Rossman. It was previously thought to be a blue Ganomalite. Rather, it is actually the Calcium analogue of Ganomalite to which it is isostructural. It forms blue hexagonal crystals less than 0.75mm in size. The holotype specimen was taken from a larger specimen that I obtained in the Fred DeVito collection and sent to Dr. Anthony Kampf. Crystals  to about .25-0.5mm and can easily be seen under the microscope. Wayneburnhamite can be distinguished from Whelanite at the Commercial quarry by the crystal habit. Wayneburnhamite crystals are hexagonal short to elongated prisms, while Whelanite forms plates. These two minerals plus Stringhamite, Nasonite, and cuprian Plombierite are the only blue minerals at Crestmore.",

There are only two other localities for Adamisite-Y at Hundholmen in Nordland, Norway, and at the Shomiokitovoe pegmatite in the Lovozero massif on the Kola Peninsula in Russia.

A rare late-stage, low-temperature hydrothermal mineral in an alkalic pegmatite dike associated with an intrusive alkalic gabbro-syenite complex.",
